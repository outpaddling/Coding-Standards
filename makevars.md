# Standard and common make variables

Below are variables that makefiles should use and respect if set via the
environment or make arguments.  Most of them are published standards, but
a few are not but are commonly used by package managers, etc.

These variables are typically set by package managers such as Debian packages,
FreeBSD ports, MacPorts, pkgsrc, etc.  They can also be set by users running
make directly from the command line or a simple install script.

Reasonable defaults are shown after ?=.

```
# Build and install commands

# C compiler
CC          ?= cc

# C compiler flags
CFLAGS      ?= -Wall -O -g

# C preprocessor (NOT C++ compiler!)
CPP         ?= cpp

# C preprocessor flags (NOT C++ flags!)
CPPFLAGS    ?= -I${LOCALBASE}/include

# C++ compiler
CXX         ?= c++ (or CC)

# C++ compiler flags
CXXFLAGS    ?= -Wall -O -g

# Fortran compiler.  Most systems don't have a native Fortran compiler so
# defaulting to GNU Fortran is as good as anything.
FC          ?= gfortran

# Fortran compiler flags
FFLAGS      ?= -Wall -O -g

# Linker (often set to CC or CXX or FC)
# If mixing C and C++, link with ${CXX} to support all C++ options
# If mixing C and Fortran, link with ${FC} to support all Fortran options
LD          ?= ${CC} (or ${CXX} or ${FC})

# Linker flags
LDFLAGS     -L${LOCALBASE}/lib

# Command for installing programs (usually "install")
INSTALL     ?= install

# Command for creating directories, e.g. /bin/mkdir
MKDIR       ?= mkdir

# Command for stripping binaries
STRIP       ?= strip

# For building static libraries
AR          ?= ar
RANLIB      ?= ranlib

# Directories

# Parent directory for all installed files.  May also be "prefix", e.g. in
# Makefiles generated by GNU configure.  If using GNU configure, override
# the prefix with "configure --prefix=" rather than "make prefix=".
PREFIX      ?= /usr/local

# Optional parent of PREFIX.  Should include a trailing "/" since makefiles
# will install to ${DESTDIR}${PREFIX} and not ${DESTDIR}/${PREFIX}.  This
# allows DESTDIR to be blank and PREFIX to be a relative path (not beginning
# with /).  This variable is mainly used by package managers to stage
# installations in a temporary directory, where they can be checked for
# conflicts and other problems before clobbering the real installation under
# PREFIX.
DESTDIR     ?= # empty

# Parent directory where dependencies such as required libraries are
# installed.  Usually the same as PREFIX.
LOCALBASE   ?= /usr/local

# Where to install man pages
MANPREFIX   ?= ${PREFIX}
MANDIR      ?= ${MANPREFIX}/man
```
